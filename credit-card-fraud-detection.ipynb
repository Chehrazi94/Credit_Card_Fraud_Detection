Description\n\nIn this project, different classification models were employed to detect fraudulent transactions. The data employed in this project can be found at the following link:\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud\n\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Credit-cards.jpg\" width=400 />\n\n### About Dataset\n\nThis dataset logs credit card transactions by European cardholders in September 2013 over two days. It reveals 492 fraud cases out of 284,807 transactions, highlighting a significant imbalance where frauds make up only 0.172% of total transactions. The dataset mainly contains numerical variables resulting from PCA transformation, and other features like 'Time', 'Amount', and the response variable 'Class' denoting fraud (1) or non-fraud (0). However, due to confidentiality, original features and background data are undisclosed\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Importing Libraries\nFirst, let's import the required libraries.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport os\n\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
